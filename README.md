## Status

NDR 6.0 is a complete rewrite of the previous NDR 5.0.  The current draft is proposed as Project Specification 01.

* HTML:  [ndr-v6.0-ps01.html](https://niemopen.github.io/niem-naming-design-rules/ndr-v6.0-ps01.html)
* PDF:  [ndr-v6.0-ps01.pdf](ndr-v6.0-ps01.pdf)

Please post comments on NDR 6.0 PS01 on the [issues page](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/issues).

## Generating NDR6

* NDR 6.0 is written in Markdown.  The source file edited by people is [ndr6src.md](ndr6src.md).
* The markdown version of NDR6 is generated via Perl scripts, which
  * Transforms defined terms in the text into dot-links (*for example,* <a class="termRef" href="">·message type·</a>) pointing to definitions in the Glossary
  * Transforms references into links to Appendix A (References)
  * Generates an index of figures and rules
  * Generates a cross reference of NDR5 rules to NDR6 rules
* HTML is generated from the intermediate Markdown with [**pandoc 3.0**](https://pandoc.org)
* PDF is generated from the HTML with wkhtmltopdf
* Build automation is controlled by a [Makefile](Makefile).
