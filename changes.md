= Changes to NDR6 after PSD01

* Rule 9-17: applies to attribute and element declarations.

  * NDR5 allows @fixed on required attributes, NDR6 does not (yet)

* Rule 9-18: should be "minOccurs and maxOccurs", not "a minOccurs..."

* Rule 9-20: same as 9-18

* Rule 7-6: fixed to apply only to literal classes
