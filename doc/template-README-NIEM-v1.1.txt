This file: should be template-README-NIEM-v1.1.txt (or similar)
Questions or suggestions for improvement: please contact Paul Knight or Chet Ensign (OASIS Project Administration).

The template package (.zip) contains the following files and directories:
-- a markdown file (.md) ... this is the main template, customized with titles and other elements for this Work Product
-- a directory "styles" containing two HTML style sheets (.css)
-- a directory "images" containing an example image file
-- this file

Notes on document preparation:
- The NIEMOpen team should edit the front page sections "Additional artifacts:" and "Related work:" as appropriate. I tried to model this on the previous NIEM NDR 5.0 publication.
- The NIEMOpen team will be responsible for the body of the specification and the Table of Contents.
- The final text section before the Appendices should be "Conformance". (although with a specification focused on conformance, that may not be needed...)
- The first Appendix should normally be "References".
- The final Appendix should normally be "Notices", which should not be modified.
- Other optional but recommended Appendices are "Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations", "Acknowledgments", and "Revision History", as shown in the template. These may be in any order.

NOTES:
- The two .css files included in the "styles" directory are also online:
-- https://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/css/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css
-- https://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/css/markdown-styles-v1.7.3a.css (this one produces HTML that resembles the github display more closely, especially for blocks of code)
-- If desired, material from the .css files can be placed into a <style> block in the <head> section of the HTML file.

I included the links to the two logo files, but HTML code (similar to the NIEM v6.0 publications) is needed for proper rendering. I've inserted the code from NIEM v6.0 ps01.
